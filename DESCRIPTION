Description: The 'rEDM' package contains C++ compiled objects that use time delay embedding to perform state-space reconstruction and nonlinear forecasting and an R interface to those objects using 'Rcpp'. It supports both the simplex projection (Sugihara 1990) and s-map forecasting algorithms (Sugihara 1994), with implementations of convergent cross mapping (Sugihara 2012).
